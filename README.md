# wireframe:

Static page built using vanilla html and css. Both the `.html` and `.css` files are broken up into sections using big fancy ASCII art, aligning with the page layout. There's also a small table of contents at the top of the `.css` page!

- _I personally used a VSCode extension called "live server" to run the page locally in the browser. It's a handy tool that requires no setup and even has hot reloading ðŸ‘Œ_

# src:

Using React components helped to visualize the different sections of the page (at least from a code perspective), and each section has it's own dedicated file in the `src/components/` folder.

## src/components:

Nothing really too complex about the page as a whole. Some notable things:

- NavBar: added a `'scroll'` event listener to the `window` to create a dynamic style for the nav container

- Splash + Careers: did a 'hacky' background trick to mimic color and opacity over the mock background images

- About: offloaded long urls to a helper object to clean up the JSX

- MapModal: render variable for the modal info to clean up the JSX

## src/components/shared:

Some reusable single-tag components for reuse around the page. I created a simple API for their use, particularly with the `'variant'` prop to support different stylings if needed.

## src/styles:

Again, not much to say here. I used my personally CSS reset (which is fairly light), variables for colors and fonts, and mixins for setting media queries and a dynamic html font-size (very helpful for even more responsiveness!).

### Random Stuff:

#### tsconfig.json:

Basically what's going on here is I'm "aliasing" the `src/` folder. First, set the root directory `{ "baseUrl": "." }` followed by creating the alias itself `{ "paths": "src/*": ["./src/*"] }` which will make any import url starting with `'src/'` instead of `'./'` will default to the `src/` folder, allowing you to import like this:

```js
import { NavBar } from 'src/components';
```

#### Barrels...

You may have already noticed that there are actually many [ index.js ] files peppered throughout the app. These are (sometimes) known as "barrel" exports, and have a few advantages when dealing with a larger file-directory. The index file in the `components/` folder for example:

```javascript
export { default as NavBar } from './navBar/navBar'
export { default as Splash } from './splash/splash'
etc...
```

You can see this in action in **` /app.js `**:

```js
import {
  NavBar,
  Splash,
  About,
  Careers,
  MapModal,
  ContactForm,
  Footer,
} from 'src/components';
```

- _Note that the import doesn't point to the index file. Node perceives **`index.js`** files as points of entry and the default file to grab exports from, essentially making it an implicit file in import statements_
